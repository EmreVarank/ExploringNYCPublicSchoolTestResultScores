**Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores**
--------------------------------------------------

This project aims to analyze test results from New York City public schools. By examining test data from different years, we seek to gain insights into student performance levels, demographic factors, and regional disparities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**🚀 About the Project**

The goal of this project is to analyze datasets containing test scores from NYC public schools to identify educational inequalities and performance differences. The project includes:

Cleaning and processing NYC public school test results,

Analyzing performance disparities across different regions,

Investigating the impact of demographic factors on student achievement,

Providing visualizations and data-driven insights.

**📝 Tasks**

The best math results are at least 80% of the *maximum possible score of 800* for math.
Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools, including "school_name" and "average_math" columns, sorted by "average_math" in descending order.
What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?

Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the "school_name" and a new column named "total_SAT", with results ordered by "total_SAT" in descending order ("total_SAT" being the sum of math, reading, and writing scores).
Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?

Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called largest_std_dev.
The DataFrame should contain one row, with:
"borough" - the name of the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation of "total_SAT".
"num_schools" - the number of schools in the borough.
"average_SAT" - the mean of "total_SAT".
"std_SAT" - the standard deviation of "total_SAT".
Round all numeric values to two decimal places.
